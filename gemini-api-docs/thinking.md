# Google Gemini Thinking Capabilities

## Overview
Thinking is an advanced reasoning capability available in Gemini 2.5 series models that enables step-by-step problem solving and complex reasoning. This feature allows models to work through problems methodically, improving accuracy and reliability for challenging tasks.

## Supported Models
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Full thinking capabilities with configurable thinking budget
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Adaptive thinking capabilities
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite**: Basic thinking capabilities

## Core Concepts

### What is Thinking?
- **Step-by-step reasoning**: Models work through problems systematically
- **Visible thought process**: Access to the model's reasoning steps
- **Enhanced accuracy**: Improved performance on complex tasks
- **Configurable depth**: Control how much reasoning effort to apply

### Key Benefits
- **Better problem solving**: Handles complex multi-step problems
- **Transparency**: See how the model reaches conclusions
- **Reliability**: More consistent results for challenging tasks
- **Adaptability**: Automatically adjusts reasoning depth as needed

## Thinking Configuration

### Basic Thinking Setup
```python
import google.generativeai as genai

# Enable thinking with default settings
model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-2.5-pro',
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
        thinking_enabled=True
    )
)

response = model.generate_content(
    \"Solve this step by step: If a train travels 120 km in 1.5 hours, and then 80 km in 1 hour, what is its average speed for the entire journey?\"
)

print(response.text)
```

### Thinking Budget Configuration
```python
# Set specific thinking budget (in tokens)
model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-2.5-pro',
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
        thinking_enabled=True,
        thinking_budget=5000  # Allocate 5000 tokens for thinking
    )
)

# Dynamic thinking (automatically adjusts)
model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-2.5-flash',
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
        thinking_enabled=True,
        thinking_budget=\"dynamic\"  # Auto-adjust thinking depth
    )
)

# Disable thinking
model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-2.5-pro',
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
        thinking_enabled=False
    )
)
```

### Accessing Thought Process
```python
# Generate content with thinking
response = model.generate_content(
    \"Calculate the compound interest on $10,000 at 5% annual rate for 3 years, compounded quarterly.\"
)

# Access the thinking process
if hasattr(response, 'thinking_content'):\n    print(\"Thinking process:\")\n    print(response.thinking_content)\n    print(\"\\nFinal answer:\")\n    print(response.text)\nelse:\n    print(response.text)\n```\n\n## Use Cases for Thinking\n\n### Mathematical Problem Solving\n```python\ndef solve_math_problem(problem: str):\n    \"\"\"Solve complex mathematical problems with thinking.\"\"\"\n    model = genai.GenerativeModel(\n        'gemini-2.5-pro',\n        generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(\n            thinking_enabled=True,\n            thinking_budget=3000\n        )\n    )\n    \n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    Solve this mathematical problem step by step:\n    {problem}\n    \n    Show your working and explain each step clearly.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    response = model.generate_content(prompt)\n    return response\n\n# Usage\nresult = solve_math_problem(\n    \"A rectangular garden is 20% longer than it is wide.
