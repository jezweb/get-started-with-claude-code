Looks good, do planning with todo, scratchpad and md so that I can compact context before we proceed.

For this task:
[describe what you want to build]

Please:
1. Create a detailed plan with todos
2. Use markdown for documentation
3. Create a scratchpad for notes and decisions
4. Stop for me to /compact before proceeding
5. Then implement with feature branching
6. Use TDD approach - tests first

Make sure the plan includes:
- Clear objectives
- Step-by-step breakdown
- Testing strategy
- Success criteria
