## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Google Cloud SDK
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash

# Initialize and authenticate
gcloud init
gcloud auth application-default login

# Install required Python packages
pip install google-cloud-aiplatform
pip install langchain-google-vertexai
pip install google-cloud-storage
```

### Basic Setup

```python
import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel
from langchain_google_vertexai import ChatVertexAI

# Initialize Vertex AI
PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"
LOCATION = "us-central1"

vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)

# Use Gemini 2.5 Flash (recommended)
model = GenerativeModel("gemini-2.5-flash")

# Or use through LangChain
chat = ChatVertexAI(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    project=PROJECT_ID,
    location=LOCATION,
    temperature=0.7
)
```
