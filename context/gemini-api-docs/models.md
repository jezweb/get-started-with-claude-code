## Integration Examples

### Python SDK
```python
import google.generativeai as genai

# Configure API key
genai.configure(api_key="your-api-key")

# Initialize model
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-2.5-flash')

# Generate content
response = model.generate_content("Your prompt here")
print(response.text)
```

### REST API
```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contents": [{
      "parts": [{"text": "Your prompt here"}]
    }]
  }'
```

## Best Practices

### Model Selection
1. Start with Gemini 2.5 Flash for most applications
2. Upgrade to Pro for complex reasoning tasks
3. Use Flash-Lite for high-volume, simple tasks
4. Test different models for your specific use case

### Performance Optimization
1. Use appropriate context window size
2. Configure thinking budget based on task complexity
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Monitor token usage and costs
5. Cache responses when appropriate

### Production Considerations
1. Implement rate limiting
2. Use proper API key management
3. Monitor model performance
4. Plan for model updates and migrations
5. Implement fallback strategies

## Limitations

### General Limitations
- Models are updated regularly, requiring adaptation
- Response quality varies with prompt quality
- Token limits apply to input and output
- Some capabilities are region-specific

### Model-Specific Limitations
- **Pro**: Higher cost per request
- **Flash**: Moderate thinking capabilities
- **Flash-Lite**: Basic reasoning for complex tasks

## Pricing Considerations

### Cost Factors
- Input tokens (text, image, audio, video)
- Output tokens
- Thinking tokens (for Pro and Flash)
- Special features (search grounding, code execution)

### Optimization Strategies
1. Use appropriate model for task complexity
2. Optimize prompt length
3. Use context caching for repeated requests
4. Monitor and analyze usage patterns
5. Consider batch processing for efficiency
