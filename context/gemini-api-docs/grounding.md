# Google Gemini Search Grounding

## Overview
Grounding with Google Search enables Gemini models to access real-time web content and current information beyond their training data. This capability significantly improves factual accuracy and reduces hallucinations by providing verifiable, up-to-date sources.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Information Access
- **Current data**: Access to latest web content and news
- **Fact verification**: Cross-reference information with reliable sources
- **Dynamic knowledge**: Stay current with rapidly changing information
- **Reduced hallucination**: Ground responses in actual web content

### Automatic Search Integration
- **Smart queries**: Automatically generates relevant search queries
- **Source processing**: Processes and synthesizes search results
- **Citation support**: Provides source attribution and metadata
- **Seamless integration**: Works transparently with normal prompts

## Supported Models
- Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Gemini 1.5 Pro
- Gemini 1.5 Flash

## Basic Usage

### Enabling Google Search Grounding
```python
import google.generativeai as genai

# Configure model with search grounding
model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-2.5-flash',
    tools=[{'google_search': {}}]
)

# Generate grounded response
response = model.generate_content(
    \"What are the latest developments in renewable energy technology in 2025?\"
)

print(response.text)
```

### Accessing Grounding Metadata
```python\nresponse = model.generate_content(\n    \"What is the current stock price of Tesla and recent news about the company?\"\n)\n\n# Access grounding metadata\nif hasattr(response, 'grounding_metadata'):\n    metadata = response.grounding_metadata\n    \n    print(\"Search queries used:\")\n    for query in metadata.search_queries:\n        print(f\"- {query}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSources:\")\n    for source in metadata.sources:\n        print(f\"- {source.uri}\")\n        \nprint(\"\\nResponse:\")\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\n## Practical Applications\n\n### News and Current Events\n```python\ndef get_current_news(topic: str, region: str = None):\n    \"\"\"Get current news about a specific topic.\"\"\"\n    model = genai.GenerativeModel(\n        'gemini-2.5-flash',\n        tools=[{'google_search': {}}]\n    )\n    \n    region_clause = f\" in {region}\" if region else \"\"\n    \n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    Provide the latest news and developments about {topic}{region_clause}.\n    Include:\n    1.
