# Run All Tests

I'll run a comprehensive test suite for your project, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. This command adapts to whatever testing frameworks you have set up.

## ðŸ§ª Test Execution Plan

   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Component tests for UI elements
   - E2E tests for user workflows
   - Performance tests if configured

### 3. **Generate Reports**
   - Test coverage report
   - Failed test summary
   - Performance metrics
   - Visual regression results (if applicable)

### 4. **Analyze Results**
   - Identify failing tests
   - Check coverage gaps
   - Highlight slow tests
   - Suggest improvements

### 5. **Update Documentation**
