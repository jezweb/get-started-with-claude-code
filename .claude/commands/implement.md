# Implement Feature with TDD

I'll help you implement any feature, component, or functionality using Test-Driven Development principles. This command works for APIs, UI components, business logic, database operations, and more.

## ðŸŽ¯ What to Implement

$ARGUMENTS

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Process

I'll follow this structured approach:

### 1. **Understand the Requirement**
   - Analyze what needs to be built
   - Identify user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Check existing code for patterns to follow

### 2. **Break Down into Steps**
   - Decompose the feature into manageable tasks
   - Create todo items for tracking
   - Identify dependencies and integration points

### 3. **Write Tests First (TDD)**
   - Create test file(s) for the feature
   - Write failing tests for expected behavior
   - Include edge cases and error scenarios
   - Set up test data and mocks

### 4. **Implement the Feature**
   - Write minimal code to make tests pass
   - Follow existing code conventions
   - Keep implementation clean and focused
   - Add necessary error handling

### 5. **Refactor and Optimize**
   - Improve code quality while keeping tests green
   - Extract reusable components/functions
   - Optimize performance if needed
   - Ensure accessibility (for UI components)

### 6. **Update Documentation**
   - Add inline documentation/comments
   - Update API docs or component docs
   - Log decisions in development scratchbook
   - Update README if needed

### 7. **Integration Testing**
   - Test feature with rest of application
   - Verify UI updates render correctly
   - Check API endpoints work end-to-end
   - Validate database operations
