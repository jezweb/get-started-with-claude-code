# Kickstart Web Application Project

I'll help you kickstart your web application project with a comprehensive setup. This command will analyze your project needs and create all necessary planning documents, testing setup, and development environment.

## üìã Project Information

First, let me understand your project:

$ARGUMENTS

## üöÄ What I'll Do

1. **Analyze Project Type**
   - Determine if it's a web app, API, or full-stack application
   - Identify technology preferences from context

2. **Create Planning Documents**
   - `mvp-development-plan.md` - Detailed implementation roadmap
   - `simplified-architecture.md` - Technical architecture overview
   - `database-schema.sql` - Database structure (if applicable)
   - `implementation-priorities.md` - Feature priority matrix
   - `quickstart-guide.md` - Get started in 5 minutes
   - `development-scratchbook.md` - Decision log and ideas

3. **Set Up Testing Framework**
   - Configure test runner (Jest/Vitest)
   - Create test structure
   - Set up TDD workflow
   - Configure E2E testing with Playwright (if applicable)

4. **Initialize Development Environment**
   - Set up build tools
   - Configure development server
   - Start `npm run dev` for live updates
   - Set up linting and formatting
   - **Python Projects**: Create and activate virtual environment
     - Create `venv` to avoid "externally managed" errors
     - Activate before any pip installs
     - Add `venv/` to `.gitignore`

5. **Create Project Structure**
   - Organize directories for clean architecture
   - Set up component/feature folders
   - Create utility and service directories

6. **Initialize Todo List**
   - Break down MVP into actionable tasks
   - Prioritize implementation order
   - Set up progress tracking

## üêç Python Environment Setup

If this project uses Python, I'll automatically:
1. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
3. Install all dependencies inside the venv
4. Add `venv/` to `.gitignore`

This prevents "externally managed environment" errors on modern systems.

Let me analyze your project context and begin the kickstart process...
