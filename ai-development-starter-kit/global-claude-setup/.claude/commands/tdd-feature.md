I want to add [feature name] using Test-Driven Development.

The feature should:
[describe functionality in detail]

Users will:
- [how they'll interact with it]
- [what they expect to happen]
- [what errors they might encounter]

TDD Process:
1. Write failing tests first
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor and improve
4. Document what was built

Create tests for:
- **Happy path** (normal use case)
- **Edge cases** (boundary conditions)
- **Error conditions** (invalid input, failures)

Use pytest and follow existing test patterns in the project.

Verify tests fail first, then implement the feature.
