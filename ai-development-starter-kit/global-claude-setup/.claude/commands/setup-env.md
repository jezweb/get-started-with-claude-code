Help me set up the environment configuration for this project.

Current project type: [web app/API/script/etc]

I need help with:
- [ ] Creating .env file from .env.example
- [ ] Setting up API keys for [list services you'll use]
- [ ] Database configuration
- [ ] Development vs production settings
- [ ] Security settings

Please:
1. Copy .env.example to .env
2. Walk me through each section I need to configure
3. Help me get the necessary API keys
4. Validate that the configuration is secure
5. Test that everything works

Make sure:
- No secrets are hardcoded in the source
- .env is in .gitignore
- All required variables are documented
- Environment-specific configs are set up properly
