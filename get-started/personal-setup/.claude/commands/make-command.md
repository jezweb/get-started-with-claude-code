# Create Your Own Custom Slash Command
<!-- VERSION: 1.0.0 -->

I want to create a custom slash command for Claude Code.

**What I want the command to do:**
[Describe what you want your command to help you with - e.g., "start a new project", "add a feature", "fix bugs", "deploy to production"]

**Command name:**
[What should I type after /user: to trigger it? Keep it short and memorable]

**Please help me:**

1. **Create the command file** in the right location (`~/.claude/commands/[name].md`)

2. **Write the prompt** that will help me with this task

3. **Show me examples** of other useful commands I might want to create

4. **Explain the syntax** so I can customize it or make more commands later

## üõ†Ô∏è Command Syntax Tips

- **Keep names short** - you'll type them often
- **Use arguments** - `$ARGUMENTS` lets you pass context
- **Reference files** - `@filename` includes file content
- **Run commands** - `!command` executes bash commands
- **Be specific** - the more context, the better help you'll get

## üöÄ Pro Tip: Project Templates

Want to create a command like `/user:start-project` with multiple stack options? Here's how:

```markdown
# Start New Project

Help me create a **$ARGUMENTS** project.

## Choose a Stack:
1. **Simple AI** - Python + FastAPI + SQLite + Gemini API
2. **Advanced AI** - Vue + Python + LangChain + Vertex AI
3. **Mobile App** - React Native + Expo + TypeScript
4. **Website** - HTML + CSS + JavaScript + Vite
5. **React App** - React + TypeScript + Tailwind

Tell me what you're building and I'll recommend the best stack!
```

This lets you say things like:
- `/user:start-project inventory tracker` 
- `/user:start-project AI chatbot`
- `/user:start-project mobile shopping app`
