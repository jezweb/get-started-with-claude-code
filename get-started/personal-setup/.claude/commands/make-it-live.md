I want to make my project available for others to use.

The project is: [brief description]

My constraints are:
- Budget: [free/cheap/doesn't matter]
- Users: [just me/small team/public]
- Technical skill: [none/basic/comfortable]

Please:
1. Recommend the simplest hosting option
2. Walk me through deployment step-by-step
3. Set up any necessary accounts
4. Make sure it's secure
5. Show me how to update it later

Test that it works and give me the URL.
