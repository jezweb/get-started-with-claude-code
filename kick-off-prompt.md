Create a plan to build the MVP think about all the details, use todo, scratchbook, and any other documents that you want to have to keep you on track right to completion such as quick start, development plan, db structure, implementation priority etc and jupyter notebooks to help ensure a successful project. Use TDD and a test suite to validate. Use BDD and Playwright MCP for E2E testing. When using Vite during development use npm run dev and leave it running in the background so I can observe visual changes.
Documents to Create
1. mvp-development-plan.md - Detailed implementation plan
2. simplified-architecture.md - Streamlined technical architecture
3. database-schema.sql - Minimal database structure for MVP
4. implementation-priorities.md - Feature priority matrix
5. quickstart-guide.md - Getting started in 5 minutes
6. development-scratchbook.md - Ideas and decisions log
7. notebooks/ - Jupyter notebook templates for each feature
