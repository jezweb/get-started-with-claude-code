# Project Planning Guide

Welcome to the project planning section! These templates help you plan and document your projects effectively before diving into code.

## 📋 What's Here

### PROJECT_BRIEF.md
A comprehensive template for documenting your app idea, including:
- App overview and purpose
- Target audience
- Core features (MVP vs nice-to-have)
- User experience design
- Technical requirements
- Success criteria

### PROJECT_CONTEXT_PROMPT.md
Ready-to-use prompts for starting Claude Code sessions with full context:
- **Detailed Version** - For complex projects needing thorough planning
- **Quick Version** - For simpler projects or quick prototypes

## 🎯 How to Use These Templates

### For New Projects

1. **Start with the Brief**
   - Copy `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` to your project folder
   - Fill out each section thoughtfully
   - Focus on MVP features first

2. **Create Your Prompt**
   - Choose from `PROJECT_CONTEXT_PROMPT.md` (detailed or quick)
   - Insert your project brief information
   - Add any specific requirements

3. **Launch Claude Code**
   - Paste your prepared prompt
   - Let Claude help you build your vision

### When to Use Which Template

#### Use the Detailed Brief When:
- Building something for others
- Working on a team
- Creating a portfolio project
- Planning a complex application
- Need to document requirements

#### Use the Quick Prompt When:
- Building a personal tool
- Learning a new technology
- Creating a quick prototype
- Testing an idea
- Time is limited

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Writing Good Briefs
- **Be Specific** - "User-friendly" → "Works on mobile, loads in <3s"
- **Prioritize** - Separate must-haves from nice-to-haves
- **Think Users** - Who will use this and why?
- **Set Boundaries** - What won't the app do?

### Working with Claude
- Share your brief for better results
- Iterate on the plan before coding
- Ask for alternatives and suggestions
- Keep the brief updated as you build

## 📊 Example Workflow

1. **Idea** → "I need a habit tracker"
2. **Brief** → Fill out PROJECT_BRIEF.md with details
3. **Prompt** → Use templates to create context
4. **Build** → Work with Claude iteratively
5. **Refine** → Update brief as project evolves

## 🚀 Beyond Planning

Once your project is planned:
- Check [examples/](../examples/) for inspiration
- Use [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](../QUICK_REFERENCE.md) during development
- Explore [advanced/](../advanced/) for complex features

## 📝 Template Philosophy

These templates follow the principle that **good planning leads to better code**. They help you:
- Clarify your vision
- Communicate effectively with Claude
- Make better technical decisions
- Avoid scope creep
- Build what you actually need

Remember: The time spent planning saves hours of development time!
