```
Create a todo app that:
- Lets users add new tasks

## Learning Tips

### Understand the Code
Ask Claude:
- "Explain how the localStorage part works"
- "Walk me through the event listeners"
- "How does the CSS make it responsive?"

### Make It Yours
- Change colors and fonts
- Add your own features
- Experiment with the design

### Common Modifications

1. **Change the Style**
   ```
   Make it look like a sticky note board
   ```

2. **Add Animations**
   ```
   Add smooth animations when tasks are added or removed
   ```

3. **Add Sounds**
   ```
   Play a sound when completing tasks
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### App Not Working?
- Make sure all files are in the same folder
- Open index.html in a web browser
- Check the browser console for errors (F12)

### Want to Start Over?
```
Let's start fresh. Create a new todo app with a different design
```

### Need Help Understanding?
```
Can you explain this part: [paste code snippet]
```

## Next Steps

### Ready for More?
1. Try adding a feature from the list above
2. Build something different (calculator, timer, notes app)
3. Check out [examples/](examples/) for more ideas

### Want to Use a Framework?
Once comfortable with vanilla JavaScript, ask Claude:
```
Convert this todo app to use Vue 3 and Vite
```

## Pro Tips

- **Save your work**: Create a GitHub repository
- **Share it**: Deploy to GitHub Pages or Netlify
- **Keep learning**: Each project teaches something new

Happy building! ðŸš€
